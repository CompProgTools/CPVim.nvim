Table of Contents Introduction Prerequisites Installation Introduction CPVim is a Neovim plugin that aims to improve worflow and productivity for neovim users that are interested in competitive programming. It targets template usage, stats, and other info that is known to be useful for contest environments, as well as general learning. Prerequisites Since CPVim.nvim is a part of the CompProgTools ecosystem, it requires the usage of CPCli our command line tool that provides deeper functionality than CPVim. Since CPVim uses the same config files and other data files such as streaks and problems, CPCli is a prerequisite that needs to be installed in order for CPVim to work. Installation Once you have CPCli installed and setup, you can check your ~/.cpcli path. If it exists, and it has the files config.json and streak.json , you are good to go! If you're using a Plugin manager such as Lazy.nvim or Packer, here are the steps. Lazy.nvim { \"compprogtools/CPVim.nvim\", lazy = false, -- ensure it loads on startup config = function() end, cmd = { \"CPVim\"}, -- ensure the plugin loads when these commands are used } Or if you're using a structured setup, return { \"compprogtools/CPVim.nvim\", lazy = false, -- ensure it loads on startup config = function() end, cmd = { \"CPVim\"}, -- ensure the plugin loads when these commands are used } Packer use 'compprogtools/CPVim' vim-plug Plug 'compprogtools/CPVim' Once thats done, you go into Neovim by running nvim and type in :CPVim . If running this command doesn't return Not an editor command: CPVim , that means you're good to go!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-cpvim-documentation","text":"This is the official site for the CPVim.nvim plugin made by CompProgTools .","title":"Welcome to CPVim Documentation"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","text":"Introduction Prerequisites Installation","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"CPVim is a Neovim plugin that aims to improve worflow and productivity for neovim users that are interested in competitive programming.
